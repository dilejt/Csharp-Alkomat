You're as sober as a skunk;
You're on you'r cups;Don't get behind the wheel;Stop now;Under the influence;Tanked up;Bevvied;Squiffy;
You're bombed mate!;Plastered;You're as drunk as a skunk;Spinning without moving;You will have hangover;You're well oiled.You'are wasted;SOZZLED;Rat-arsed;drunk as hell
You're three sheets to the wind;pissed as a newt;
Shit-faced;
