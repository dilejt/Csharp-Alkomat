You're are sober;You're blind, stinking sober!;As sober as a judge;Dry;Abstinent;Clear-headed
You're on you'r cups;Don't get behind the wheel;Stop now;Under the influence;Tanked up;Bevvied;Squiffy;Stoned
You're bombed mate!;Plastered;You're as drunk as a skunk;Spinning without moving;You will have hangover;You're well oiled.Wasted;SOZZLED;Rat-arsed;Drunk as hell
You're three sheets to the wind;Pissed as a newt
Shit-faced;Living as a Dead Man;Sleeping with the fishes;Dancing with ghosts
